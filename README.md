## Hangman

This project goal's was to create the game Hangman where the person write the word and another person tries to guess it.

I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

#### What I've practiced/learned:
- Anchor to the same page (HTML);
- Hover effects(CSS);
- Flexbox (CSS);
- Split method (JavaScript);
- Change style (Javascript);
- Refresh the page (Javascript);
- Adding a collaborator (GitHub);
- Requesting code review (GitHub).


You can check the project ready here (NOT READY YET)

#### What I plan to do:
- The person chooses the word;
- The color of the circles change when you make a mistake;
- When you get a letter right, it appears on the right place
